explain n+1 query & how to avoid

By default rails queries use lazy loading -
they load the parent object w/o retrieving the children.

A n + 1 query is caused by this lazy loading -
when n queries are made for the child records + 1 for
the parent.

This problem can be solved with eager loading by using
the includes method in the query to load the child
records at the same time as the parent record.
