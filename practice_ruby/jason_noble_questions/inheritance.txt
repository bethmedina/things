Give examples both with classical inheritance and with composition of how you would build objects
representing pick-up trucks, compact cars, and SUVs. don't get overly technical w/ internals of cars

Classical (is-a relationship):

class Foo
  attr_accessor :thing
end

class Bar < Foo
  attr_accessor :other_thing
end

b = Bar.new
b.thing = "something"

b is_a? Foo => true
b is_a? Bar => true
b.class == Foo => false


Composition (has-a relationship):

class Foo
  attr_accessor :thing
end

class Bar
  def initialize
    @foo = Foo.new
  end

  def thing
    @foo.thing
  end
end

b = Bar.new
b.thing
