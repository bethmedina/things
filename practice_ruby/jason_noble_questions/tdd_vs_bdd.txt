What is TDD?  BDD?  How would you describe
the difference?

Test Driven Development is a software development
methodology where tests drive the software development.
Failing tests are written first, then the code to make
the tests pass is written, and then code can be
refactored. As long as the test pass the developer
can then continue the cycle with writing some more
tests.

Behavior Driven development focuses on the behavior
that drives the development. Tests are more verbose
and read more like a sentence rather than code.
