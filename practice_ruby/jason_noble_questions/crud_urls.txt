Explain what the 8 URLs in a standard CRUD Scaffold do.

GET /things - gets a list of all the things
GET /things/1 - gets the thing with id  = 1
GET /things/new - creates a new thing
GET /things/1/edit - allows you to edit the thing where id = 1
  (renders the view)
POST /things - add a thing
PATCH/PUT /things/1 - update thing where id = 1
  (interacts w/ model)
DELETE /things/1 - delete the thing where id = 1
