Where would you put code you wanted to be run once
on Rails startup?  What sorts of code would you expect
to find in that directory?

Either config/environment.rb or config/initializers

Code in environment.rb would be environment-specific.

Code in config/initializers is set-up code that would
run after the gems load but before the application loads.
