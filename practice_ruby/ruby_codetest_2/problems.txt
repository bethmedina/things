1. Capitalize every nth word (with offset)

2. Return the Fibonacci of n

3. Calculate the golden ratio.
in between 1.61800 and 1.61806
Given two numbers a and b with a > b > 0, the ratio is b / a.
Let c = a + b, then the ratio c / b is closer to the golden ratio.
Let d = b + c, then the ratio d / c is closer to the golden ratio.
Let e = c + d, then the ratio e / d is closer to the golden ratio.
If you continue this process, the result will trend towards the golden ratio.

4. Determine if n is prime

5. Give the square root of a number
Using a binary search algorithm, search for the square root of a given number.
Do not use the built-in square root function.
